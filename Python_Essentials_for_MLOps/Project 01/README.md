# ðŸŽ¬ Project 01 - A Movie Recommendation System in Python
The project is based on the _Build a Movie Recommendation System in Python_, a Portfolio Project available on [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/). The goal is to modify the project by applying the concepts learned in the MLOps course.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements/Technologies
- **Python**: Version 3.10.8
- **pylint**: Version 2.17.5
- **astroid**: Version 2.15.6
- **termcolor**: Version 2.3.0
- **tabulate**: Version 0.9.0
- **tqdm**: Version 4.66.1
- **pytest**: Version 7.4.2
 
 You can find the full list of requirements in the `requirements.txt` file.

## ðŸš€ Installation Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python version 3.10.8 installed.
2. Clone the repository: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thaisaraujom/mlops2023.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the `Python_Essentials_for_MLOps` directory.
4. Install the required libraries: 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ``` 
5. Run the project:
   ```
   python movie_recommendations.py -t "Movie Title"
   ```
   replacing `Movie Title` with the title of the movie you want to get recommendations for.
6. To run the tests, run the following command:
   ```
    pytest
   ```
7. Alternatively, you can use **GitHub Codespaces** for a quick setup:
   - In the main repository page, click on the `Code` button and select `Codespaces`.
   - From the dropdown, select `Open with Codespaces` or `Create codespace on main`.
   - This will initiate a Codespace environment where you can code directly in the browser without local setup.
